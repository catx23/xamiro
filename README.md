## Additional components

- _XBlox_, a Visual programming language for extending the file manager and other things easier. Open test/blox.xblox example file (this feature is pre alpha!). You need to open the file manager
  explicitly via url parameter: index.php?profile=xblox&debug=true or index.php?profile=xode&debug=true. Currently there is are release versions of it. 
- Visual HTML editor for Dojo (aka Maqetta), currently support also _XBlox_ for widget/node properties. Same as xblox: You need to open the file manager
  explicitly via url parameter: index.php?profile=xblox&debug=true or index.php?profile=xode&debug=true. Currently there is are release versions of it.

- Node.JS service management and shell. This feature is not activated yet. 
- Hot-code replacement for AMD/Dojo apps. For those folks who know :-)

##Status


File manager: little unstable! There is still a lot of old and rubbish code to be removed. However, this project is 
under active development and not yet official released.

    $cd xbox-app
    $git submodule init
    $git submodule update

### Full Checkout (Checks out full tree: 1GB+)

    $git clone --recursive https://github.com/mc007/xbox-app
    $git submodule foreach --recursive git checkout master

###Installation via one-click installer (downloads zip and un-compresses it)

1. Upload via FTP this file into any directory on your server https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mc007/xbox-app/master/install/remote/install.php
2. Make the parent directory writeable (755)!
3. Open the url http://mysite/install.php in your browser!
4. wait !
5. The installer downloaded https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mc007/xbox-app/master/DIST/xbox.zip and unzipped it in http://mysite/xbox-app/ by default
6. Open http://localhost/xbox-xapp/ 
7. Delete the install.php from your server!

### Usage

Navigate on your web server to : **http://localhost/xbox-app/index.php**

Open in different layout modes, append the entry URL by: 

index.php?**layout=single**: Single panel

index.php?**layout=dual**: Dual panel

index.php?**layout=preview**:  Preview layout (split view with media preview)

index.php?**layout=preview&theme=dot-luv**: Preview layout in dark theme (split view with media preview)

### Open debug version 

http://localhost/xbox-app/index.php?debug=true

### Build Javascript main file

    
    $cd client/src
    $sh buildstandalone.sh    

This will create single layer file which contains all Dojo based in src/xfile/dojo/xbox.js!

### Resources (Javascript/CSS/Fonts,...)
- Client-Debug version : see in client/src/lib/xbox/resources-debug.json
- Client-Release version : see in client/src/xfile/xbox/resources-release.json

#### Footprint
- Javascript total: 2.8MB (1.4MB Core + 1MB plugins) unzipped or 0.6 MB when gzipped
- CSS total: 50KB
- Images: 20KB - 50KB. We do optimize it further
- XHR: 50KB for the initial load(gzipped)
- Total: 750kb gzipped

There are further optimizations in progress but we don't think we can get the minimal version below 700KB!



### The Index.html
There is no such thing! HTML related parts are pulled through the resource configuration mentioned in "Resources" above.
This technique has been proven for us since many years in many projects as we develop authoring software and those resources
needed to be managed in a more fashioned manner. However,

the **HEAD** comes from:
- Client-Debug version : client/src/lib/xbox/Header.js
- Client-Release version : client/src/xfile/xbox/Header.js

the **BODY** part comes from:

- Client-Debug version : client/src/lib/xbox/index.html
- Client-Release version : client/src/xfile/xbox/index.html

### The index.php

 1. Is more of interest to you, it basically does setup a 'xfile' configuration and fires the PHP framework
 2. Handles RPC and client rendering


### Update all

    $bash
    $cd xbox-app
    $git submodule foreach git pull origin master


### Contribute
open a Github issue and let me know :-)

###Roadmap
1. Update to ibm-js framework: in progress
2. remove all Dijit stuff: postponed
3. Code cleanup
4. Create a Node.js server version
5. Add proper test units 
6. ...
