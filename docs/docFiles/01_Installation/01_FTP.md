#### Option 1: Upload all files (slow)
  
  This option requires you to upload all files. Currently there are a few thousand files, totalling 22MB+ on the disc.
  
  
#### Option 2: Upload one file:
  
      1. Upload from the release zip the file from the folder install/remote/install.ph_ to a folder on your server, ideally
      into a folder called: "xamiro"
      2. After uploading, edit install.ph_ and adjust the parameters(optional)
      3. rename install.ph_ to install.php
      4. open your browser and point it to your website, eg: "http://localhost/xamiro/install.php"
